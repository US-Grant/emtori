                    Hitori is played with a grid of squares or cells, with each cell initially containing a number. The game is played by eliminating squares/numbers and this is done by blacking them out. The objective is to transform the grid to a state wherein all three following rules are true:
    no row or column can have more than one occurrence of any given number;
    black cells cannot be adjacent, although they can be diagonal to one another;
    the remaining numbered cells must be all connected to each other, horizontally or vertically.
